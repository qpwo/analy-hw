## Analysis Homeworks

In Fall 2015 I am enrolled in a real analysis class (MATH 431) at WKU.

Every couple weeks we have a problem set due and I type mine. Here you
can see the source files and the compiled PDF's.

The problems are from the 4th edition of _Introduction to Real Analysis_ by
Robert G Bartle and Donald R Sherbert.
